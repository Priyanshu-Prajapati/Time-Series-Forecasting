# ðŸ“ˆ Time Series Forecasting

Predict future values of a time series using deep learning models like LSTM and GRU, which are ideal for sequential and temporal data. This project focuses on temperature forecasting using historical daily minimum temperatures.

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

This project uses **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**, specifically **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** and optionally **GRU (Gated Recurrent Units)**, to forecast future values in a time series. The dataset used contains daily minimum temperatures in Melbourne, Australia from 1981 to 1990.
